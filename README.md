super miscellaneous codes that has no reason to exist but does. Just to note; all of it is vibecoded. So keep your expectations low alright. Below are the descriptions of the codes around here.

## what is "duovm.c"
a useless Duo Series emulator. What it is you might think?? DUO Adept?? DUO Tiny???? DUO Mega???????
Well, none. It's the one at the main page of https://ostracodfiles.com/. Named "DUO Navigator". Nothing else. Goodluck trying to write a program for this shit, only thing i know it can run is the default program Duo Navigator runs at https://ostracodfiles.com/ again. The DUO line is made by Jack Einsenmann. There's no assembler for this machine, so... yup, that's why its useless. The main program is named "program.hex", run it with whoever you compiled the program's name as and watch it function. The only way you can create programs for this is by HEX codes that relate to the opcodes of Navigator, goodluck with that lmao.
